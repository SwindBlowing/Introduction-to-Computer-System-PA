For the guide of this programming assignment,
refer to [http://nju-ics.gitbooks.io/ics2021-programming-assignment/content/](https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook/ics2021/index.html)

The following subprojects/components are included. Some of them are not fully implemented.
* [NEMU](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/nemu)
* [Abstract-Machine](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/abstract-machine)
* [Nanos-lite](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/nanos-lite)
* [Navy-apps](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/navy-apps)

You can view the system I realized by firstly clone the original repository in the manual, and then pull my codes. Use ``cd nanos-lite`` and then ``make ARCH=riscv run``. Don't forget to switch to pa4 branch.
